# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
.idea
# Ignore bundler config.
server/.bundle
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
server/log/*
server/tmp/*
!/server/log/.keep
!/server/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
server/tmp/pids/*
!/server/tmp/pids/
!/server/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
server/storage/*
!/server/storage/.keep
server/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
server/config/master.key
server/.env

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.
